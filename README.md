PLVis is a computational pipeline designed to facilitate rapid and intuitive visual analysis of protein sequences using machine learning techniques. By utilizing pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs), dimensionality reduction, and clustering methods, PLVis enables researchers to explore and compare proteomes with ease.
